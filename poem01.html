		<p> <b>There Will Come Soft Rain</b><br></p>
<p>There will come soft rain and the smell of the ground,<br>
And swallows circling with their shimmering sound;<br>
And frogs in the pools singing at night,<br>
And wild plum trees in tremulous white;<br>
Robins will wear their feathery fire,<br>
Whistling their whims on a low fence-wire;<br>
And not one will know of the war, not one<br>
Will care at last when it is done.<br>
Not one would mind, neither bird nor tree,<br>
If mankind perished utterly;<br>
And Spring herself, when she woke at dawn<br>
Would scarcely know that we were gone.<br>
